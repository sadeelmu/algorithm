# algorithms_design_and_analysis

This is a repository of some of the code I developed while learning the course Algorithms Design and Analaysis, wherein we explored optimization of code through various methods.

The work I am most proud of is titled dfs.cpp which is a project that does the following:
Consider the LinkedIn solution that allows people to connect on a social media platform for employment purposes. Every user on LinkedIn can establish one or more connections with other users on the same platform. 
In addition to the connections, assume that LinkedIn also tracks and saves the employer company of each user.
The code I implemented allows a user to discover how connected he/she is to some company.
The function targets a specific input company and prints how far the user is in his connections from that company, and how many users he is connected to from that company at that level.
